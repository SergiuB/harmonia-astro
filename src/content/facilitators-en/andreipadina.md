My name is Andrei Padina, and I am a graduate of the Faculty of Sports and Motor Performance. I am a certified nutrition technician, NeuroTrainer in the Neuroptimal method, specialist in Functional Range Conditioning mobility, certified in Human Garage fascial manipulation, and neuromuscular activation through the Reflexive Performance Reset method.

After 20 years of practicing performance sports, I decided nine years ago to focus on longevity, mental health, hormonal health, and biohacking methods. My goal is to extend my life and repair the repercussions of performance sports activity.

Additionally, I practice ice swimming and cold exposure using the Wim Hof method to enhance body resilience and promote overall health.

Through the knowledge and experience I have gained, I help people improve their well-being and achieve an optimal balance between mind and body. I am dedicated to promoting a healthy and balanced lifestyle based on the latest research and practices in health and physical performance.
