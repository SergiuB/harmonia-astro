          "Bach Therapy is associated with complementary medicine implemented by Dr. Edward Bach.
          It involves the use of floral essences obtained from natural, non-toxic ingredients,
          harvested from spontaneous flora. Bach flower remedies represent a form of therapy that contributes
          to restoring the balance between mind, soul, and body and to acquiring qualities opposite to those we lack.
          They are not medicines but gentle flower remedies, without contraindications, capable of
          eliminating emotional blockages and releasing the self-healing potential we all have.",
