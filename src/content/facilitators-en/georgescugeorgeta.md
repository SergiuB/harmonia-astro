I am an energy therapist specialized in aura cleansing, energetic balancing, and personal development on a spiritual level, working intuitively with the subtle fields of the being. Through a gentle and profound approach, I support the release of emotional and energetic blockages, reconnection with the self, and the restoration of inner harmony.

I believe in healing that begins from within and in divine guidance that appears when a person is ready to transform.
