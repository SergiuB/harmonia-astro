I guide people gently through the Rebirthing Breathwork process and integrate my expertise as an NLP Practitioner, Reiki Practitioner, Theta Healing therapist, Authentic Relating facilitator, and organizer of events and retreats dedicated to inner transformation and personal development.

I have guided over 300 people through this process, focusing on creating a safe space, building authentic relationships with oneself and others, clearly explaining the steps, and providing solid energetic and emotional support.

I have explored over 50 countries and dedicated more than 20 years to understanding the motivations, blockages, and strategies that help people achieve peace, clarity, joy, and inner balance.

I apply and combine various techniques for emotional release and healing, such as Letting Go/The Sedona Method, to support people in reconnecting with their authentic selves and discovering a life filled with clarity, joy, and meaning.
