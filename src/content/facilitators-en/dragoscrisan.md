          "Craniosacral Therapy is a gentle and profound form of listening to the body. Through light touch and deep presence, the body is invited to access its own self-regulating intelligence. We work with the craniosacral rhythm, supporting the nervous system in finding its balance at its own pace — guided by what we call the inner physician, the body’s inherent wisdom.",
          "During the session I use both the traditional 10-step Upledger protocol (CST1) and specific techniques for the cranial base, the temporomandibular joint, and the deep fascia (CST2). The somato-emotional dimension (SER1) naturally finds its place within the session: old repressed emotions may surface through sensations, breath, or micro-movements. Clearing the Expression Pathway (diaphragms, hyoid bone, palatine and zygomatic bones) allows the body to relax, and the internal structures can find a new inner equilibrium.",
          "Touching the Brain techniques (CTTB1 & CTTB2) help us access the more subtle layers of the nervous system and glial cells — cells that store our history since the embryonic phase — encouraging and supporting the harmonization and alignment of the body’s energetic fields.",
          "In essence, I am a facilitator who creates a safe space where your body can relax, express itself, and reorganize without limiting interventions. A place where nothing is forced and nothing is corrected — we simply listen and support what the body is already expressing.",

          "I deeply resonate with this perspective that neither blames nor seeks to repair, but honors — family constellations open a path we could not have seen alone. It is a gentle and profound process, unfolding at each person’s pace, where nothing is forced; we simply follow the movements arising from within, like a breath you recognize after a long time.",

Hi! I’m Dragoș Crișan, and I invite you to travel with me into your body. We will listen to it — in silence and with patience — supporting it exactly where it needs, and gently encouraging it toward relaxation and inner balance. We will do this with clear intention through Craniosacral Therapy, using the Upledger method.

My journey into working with people began with my very first heartbeat and continued through every life experience, eventually taking shape naturally in August 2022 when I began my personal therapeutic process — a journey that taught me that true depth does not come from theory, but from the courage to meet ourselves and the abyss of our own unconscious.

Each experience has since become part of the foundation from which I view and understand people — as a declaration of love… a structure of values, emotions, and complex dynamics through which love expresses itself, taking on unique forms that are always in transformation.

Today, I work through a holistic and integrative approach grounded in presence, listening, and respect for each person’s unique rhythm — nothing is wrong, and nothing needs to be fixed. Everything gains meaning when it is seen, heard, and gently addressed… the symptom invites us into introspection and tells us, in its own language, what the mind is not yet ready to look at. The body is the one that listens to us and loves us unconditionally — it shapes itself moment by moment in the image and likeness of our inner world.

For me, therapeutic work is not a profession, but a form of presence… a movement of the soul that guides us with patience and wisdom toward what is right for us. In parallel, I am preparing to become a psychoanalytic therapist — a natural step in the evolution of a process that never truly ends, but continues to grow together with me and with the people who come toward me.
