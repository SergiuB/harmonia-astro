Amalia – Facilitator for Postural Balance and Personalized Nutrition

About Me
I am Amalia, 41 years old, and I dedicate my life to the balance between movement, nutrition, and well-being. Sports and nutrition are more than passions – they are my vocation.

My Journey
I started in the world of performance sports, being a national and international judo champion. This experience shaped me deeply – physically, mentally, and emotionally. After retiring from competitions, I continued to share the discipline and joy of movement through aerobic gymnastics, which I taught for 15 years.

Combining movement with a deep understanding of nutrition, I pursued a master's degree in Nutrition and Food Safety at the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy. This training gave me a complete perspective on how lifestyle influences health and inner balance.

In recent years, I have explored other forms of connection with the body and nature – surfing and SUP, which I have been practicing passionately for over 5 years.

What I Offer
My services are fully personalized and tailored to individual needs. I integrate:
• Postural evaluation and balance
• Personalized nutritional counseling
• Integrated movement and nutrition programs designed to support the regeneration and balance of each body individually

I work with gentleness, professionalism, and respect for the unique rhythm of each person.
