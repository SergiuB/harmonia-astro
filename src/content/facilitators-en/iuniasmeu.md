I am Iunia Smeu: mother, woman, HUMAN.
Whenever the Universe calls, I guide and support from the role of a transpersonal therapist.
In this world and in this life, the mission I came to fulfill reached me early. At the age of 19, I began an inner journey that I did not know at the time would never end: the evolution towards the Self.
When I realized that I knew so much that I understood I knew nothing, I began to open myself to supporting the inner journeys of those around me.
I love nature and plants. I live with them in an inexplicable symbiosis and, intuitively, I know each plant and how it can be of use to me. I also create remedies for the body from plants in the form of creams, oils, or perfumes.
Thus, although my diplomas recommend me as a psychotherapist, the way I guide and support is holistic and transpersonal.
Among the tools I have used in previous collaborations are: breathwork (holotropic, rebirth), guided meditation, Access Bars & EFT, timeline therapy, spinal flow energetics, cacao ceremony, and Rapé ritual.
In my opinion, knowledge is power. I constantly direct my antennas towards new sources of information, both from science and the esoteric domain, which could improve the practices within the therapies I support.
I also believe that everything is interconnected, so I always consider astral aspects, not just lived experiences, using tools such as Human Design or Gene Keys.

If you feel the need for guidance and support in a gentle and revealing way, within the therapies and events I guide, you will find the space open for that.
