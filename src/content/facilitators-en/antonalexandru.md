          "Siberian throat singing is a unique style of sound production that requires a relaxed and synchronized presence at the physical body, inner state, and mental focus levels.",
          "What can we experience through throat singing? Sound is energy, the acoustic transposition of an inner experience. We all know how powerful emotions are – they can inspire us to do extraordinary things or destroy us when we are caught in them and spiral downward.",
          "Throat singing, through its three main styles, connects us to three essential levels of human existence:",
          "The KARGYRAA style expresses the instinctual, animal energy from the lower abdomen and the base of the spine. When we do not assume these forces within us, they control us and push us from behind like true forces of nature. When we become aware of them and express them, we recover an immense reservoir of vitality, creativity, grounding, confidence, abundance, and stability. We tangibly feel that we have a place on earth and can relax in it.",
          "The KHOOMEY style opens the resonance of the chest and our immense capacity to generate love, warmth, affection, acceptance, and comfort – as if we remember that every pain has its lullaby.",
          "The SYGYT style uses the resonance of the head, helping to deeply relax and energize the brain, as well as the pineal and pituitary glands.",
          "Among the benefits of practicing throat singing, we discover:
          - grounding and awakening vital energy;
          - amplifying intuition and creativity;
          - feeling truly at home in your body;
          - deep relaxation through vibration experienced at the cellular level;
          - activating the body's self-healing ability;
          - dissolving stress and stagnant emotions;
          - amplifying the state of meditative calm;
          - reconnecting to the state of inner freedom;",

          "Many of us do not use our voice truly because somewhere, sometime, we learned that it is reserved for those with talent and musical ear, or we have negative beliefs about our voice - that it sounds too thin, too deep, etc.",

A graduate of the Faculty of Psychology, I have trained in ancestral healing methods from various traditions and transgenerational trauma therapy.

In 2010, I had my first contact with Siberian throat singing (throat-singing), and since then, I have continued to deepen harmonization at all levels with the help of consciously produced sounds.

I have traveled to Tuva, Yakutia, Altai, and Mongolia, and as a result of these experiences, I discovered my passion for awakening life through song.

Since 2013, I have been practicing Tibetan Buddhism and integrating the millennial wisdom of discovering our true nature, which is present in each of us, at every moment, into the workshops I hold.
