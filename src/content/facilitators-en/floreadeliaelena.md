She began her journey into alternative medicine over seven years ago at the renowned Loi Kroh Traditional Thai Massage School in Chiang Mai, where she completed an intensive program and trained as a Thai massage practitioner.

Drawn to the healing properties of essential oils, she devoted time to study aromatherapy with experienced practitioners, refining her skills to offer thoughtful, effective treatments for people seeking wellbeing and balance.

Today, Delia provides her own holistic therapies that combine a variety of techniques and tools to restore balance and harmony across the whole body.
