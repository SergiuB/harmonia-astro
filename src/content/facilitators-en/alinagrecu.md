Alina Grecu – Yoga & Pilates Reformer Instructor / Craniosacral Therapist
500h YTT Yoga Alliance | 100h Yin Yoga | Pilates Reformer Instructor

I am Alina Grecu, a yoga and pilates instructor with a holistic approach focused on body-mind-soul balance. I completed a 500h Yoga Alliance training in Hatha and Vinyasa, as well as a 100h specialization in Yin Yoga. Additionally, I am a certified Pilates Reformer instructor, conducting sessions that combine postural alignment with inner strength and movement fluidity.

I teach yoga classes (Hatha, Vinyasa, Yin), meditation, and Pilates Reformer in a gentle yet energizing style, supporting both tension release and deep reconnection with one's own body.

I am training as a psychologist and passionate about how conscious movement can support nervous system regulation and emotional healing processes. For me, yoga and pilates are not just physical practices but therapeutic tools that cultivate presence, clarity, and vitality.

Facilitating classes is, for me, a form of active presence and authentic support – I create a safe space where each person is encouraged to listen to their inner rhythm and become friends with their own body.

"Your body is the temple of your soul. Look at it with love, move it with respect, and listen to what it has to tell you."
