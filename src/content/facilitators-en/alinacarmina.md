          "Back in Harmony is a combination of therapeutic massage techniques, mobilizations and stretches that integrates elements from all the manual therapies I studied: Thai therapeutic massage, Yumeiho, Russian massage, shiatsu, acupressure, somatic and relaxation massage, lymphatic and anti‑cellulite massage, technician/therapist masseur training, pieces of craniosacral, myofascial and fascial release, visceral/abdominal massage, deep tissue, Chi Nei Tsang and more. It is a complex approach that works on several body layers and targets the musculoskeletal system, fascia and energetic pathways, using deep pressure, slow and intentional movements, and gentle mobilizations. It aims to release muscle tension and contractures, restore flexibility and mobility, improve symmetry and posture, and assist in maintenance, improvement, and sometimes long‑term recovery in conditions such as disc herniations, kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis, etc.",
          "The benefits of this approach are multiple:",
          "• Pain relief and reduction of muscle tension and contractures.",
          "• Improved flexibility and mobility, especially for people with restricted movement due to injuries or prolonged sedentary lifestyle.",
          "• Realignment of body posture and restoration of symmetry, addressing issues such as scoliosis, kyphosis and other postural imbalances.",
          "• Stimulation of blood flow and lymphatic circulation, helping remove toxins and improving overall metabolism.",
          "• Stress reduction and emotional release through manipulation of energetic channels.",
          "• Improved nervous system function, increasing the body's ability to self‑regulate and heal from within.",
          "• Improved respiratory function, beneficial for people with breathing difficulties or tension in the chest area.",
          "• Increased vitality and emotional balance, promoting a sense of peace and wellbeing.",
          "This approach is adaptable: each session is personalized according to the individual's needs, ensuring an effective therapy for various conditions.",
          "For single‑visit clients, a standard massage is given, aligned with what is needed at that time. It can be gentle and relaxing or deeper and somewhat painful but with longer lasting effects.",
          "For stronger therapeutic effect and visible results, I recommend a recurring weekly approach where I can apply different techniques from one session to the next so we progressively work toward improvement and deeper transformation.",
          "In cases of conditions such as disc herniation, protrusions or similar issues, especially with persistent inflammation and stronger pain, I recommend a period of twice‑weekly sessions until the acute pain subsides.",

For as long as I can remember, I have been deeply connected to the world around me, more sensitive to the environment I live in. I discovered that emotions and psycho-emotional states can somatize and manifest as various physical ailments, and often doctors could not identify the true causes of these problems. Over time I went through a carousel of experiences that affected me on multiple levels. That is how my healing journey began — when I decided to take responsibility for my own recovery and transformation.

The first moment of realization came fairly early, when I started with competitive dance and movement. My inner states began to calm as I trained in performance sport, which I practiced for nearly eight years. After a long break, when some issues returned, I understood how important movement is for me.

Over time I explored many forms of dance and movement (some of which I later taught) — from Latin social dance, contemporary dance, various hip‑hop styles, Axis Syllabus, contact improvisation, dance therapy, to movement disciplines such as calisthenics, natural movement, play‑fight, pilates, and tae‑bo. At the same time I discovered the transformative power of practices like yoga, qigong, Zen, Osho meditations, plant‑based/shamanic approaches, and reiki. I gradually understood how the body’s flexibility, tone and freedom of movement are tightly linked to the flexibility, tone and freedom of thought, moods and emotions.

These personal searches led me through many alternative medicine and complementary therapy methods, studied and applied on myself: massage therapy, sound healing and music, breathing techniques and meditation, dance therapy, herbal medicine, integrative nutrition and naturopathy, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, the connections between illnesses and psycho‑emotional states, and other related approaches.

In 2011 I began practicing manual therapy, and that passion set me on a path of continuous learning. I studied reflexology, somatic and relaxation massage, lymphatic and anticellulite massage, and completed a technician/therapist masseur course. In 2013 I discovered MMT (Mixed Manual Therapy), a complex therapeutic method — a mix of manual techniques drawn from various styles: Thai therapeutic massage, Yumeiho, Russian massage, shiatsu. After three years of intensive study I began applying these techniques at the Varuna Foundation, and since then I have continued to explore practices such as fascial and deep tissue massage, visceral abdominal massage (Chi Nei Tsang), acupressure point therapy, myofascial meridians and fascial adjustments, elements of osteopathy and craniosacral work, and ongoing exploration.

I started studying yoga in 2010 and practicing asana from 2013; later I became certified as an instructor at a Yoga Alliance–registered school. Through yoga practice many changes happened in me, both physically and on other levels — inside and out. The most constant feeling is that calm presence, a state of being beyond being someone, a movement toward harmony and well‑being.

All of this helped me know myself better, to look at myself honestly, to accept myself as I can, and to change where and how I can. They taught me gentleness toward myself and others, opened and shifted my perception, and filled me with wonder at how complex and interconnected everything — including the human being — truly is.

Postural Alignment came as a perfect complement to what I had learned so far. I understood again that postural reeducation is not only about the body but also about inner retraining. Now I know that when body, mind and heart are in harmony, profound change is possible. The search for balance — harmony between mind, body and heart — guides me every day, and what I do, I do from the heart.

I am especially passionate about guiding people to regain balance and health through therapies that not only align the body but the whole being. The lessons from my journey of self‑discovery and healing are something I wish to share with you. Studying all these practices led me to a system that allows me to work with each person in a unique, personalized way. Each method I learned gave me a new perspective on being in this body, and today I integrate them to offer a broader approach that goes beyond relaxation, focusing on recovery and healing to help you embrace and overcome physical and psycho‑emotional limitations, improve posture, and regain mobility.

I know change is a personal journey and everyone has their own path. Yet there is always a way to find balance and improve physical, emotional, energetic and mental well‑being.

The therapies I offer are dedicated to those who want to experience real transformation. Whether it’s releasing pain, restoring correct posture, or reconnecting with yourself, each session is a step toward harmony and balance. Together we will work so you feel better, lighter, and more aligned with yourself.

If you are ready to make a change, I invite you to join me on a journey of alignment, self‑discovery and harmonization.
