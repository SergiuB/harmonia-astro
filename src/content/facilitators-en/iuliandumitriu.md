A calm and empathetic massage therapist, Iulian discovered his passion for the art of touch five years ago after a career in IT. The search for balance and authentic connection with people led him to massage therapy, where he found meaning and joy. He integrates relaxation techniques, deep tissue, stretching, reflexology, and therapeutic massage elements into his sessions, creating a personalized experience to reduce stress, tension, and anxiety. He practices with passion, presence, and respect for each person's body and rhythm.
