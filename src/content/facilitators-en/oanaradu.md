I am an enthusiastic and positive person, passionate about movement and well-being since childhood. As a former karate and sports dance practitioner, I have always loved exploring new ways to stay active – from dancing and hiking to yoga and acroyoga.

In 2019, I tried yoga for the first time, and it opened up a new universe of self-discovery and balance. Through yoga, I discovered not only a way to restore my hormonal balance but also a deeper understanding of how I can support and guide people on their journey to well-being.

Combining my professional training as a specialist pharmacist with my love for conscious movement, I am excited to share the benefits of yoga in an accessible and joyful way.
