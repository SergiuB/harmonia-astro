I am an Ashtanga Yoga instructor with over a decade of experience, known for my rigorous and disciplined teaching style. I began my yoga journey under the guidance of Irena Zaarour and Alexandra Solomon, developing a profound and authentic practice.

As a follower of the pure tradition of Ashtanga Yoga, I emphasize respecting traditional sequences and the correct and precise execution of postures. My teaching approach is firm but fair, aimed at guiding practitioners towards an authentic understanding of the discipline, surpassing physical and mental comfort zones.

I consider myself a demanding but dedicated teacher who encourages growth through perseverance and self-discipline. I believe in the transformative power of practice and guide each session with integrity and respect for tradition.
