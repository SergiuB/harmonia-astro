          "TAIJIQUAN (also known as TAI CHI or TAI CHI CHUAN) is the most widespread internal style of Chinese martial arts,
          practiced today worldwide mainly as a therapeutic discipline, for maintaining health, increasing vitality,
          and balancing psycho-emotional states. Born as a martial art, Taijiquan is based on fluid, slow movements, yet not lacking vigor,
          accompanied by an entire philosophy and science. The continuous, fluid movements of Taijiquan are based on the principle that flowing water
          never stagnates. The harmonious forms relax both the muscles and the joints, rejuvenating the body from within.
          Through movement and meditation, Taijiquan brings robust health, a calm mind, and an open heart.",
