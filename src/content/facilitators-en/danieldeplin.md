This opens the energetic field, activates the parasympathetic and limbic systems, and brings us into a deep state where we have greater access to emotions and the subconscious. Many people experience dream-like states during sessions.",

My name is Daniel. I am a Rebirthing Breathwork facilitator and fitness coach with a deep passion for health and personal growth. Through experiences gained on numerous journeys to Peru and India, and through the healing techniques I explored during my own transformation, I discovered Rebirthing Breathwork. I was profoundly moved by its vast potential for change, and since then I have chosen to guide others on this transformative path.
