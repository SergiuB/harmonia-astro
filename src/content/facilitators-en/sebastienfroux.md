Massage has always been a part of my life; I gave my first one at the age of 11.  
Fifteen years ago, I completed massage school — mostly with the intention of improving my technical skills. For many years, I offered my services for free to friends and clients while working in other fields in parallel (for example: organizing nature events through *evadeazacunoi*), until the world of therapy “called” me.

For the past 6 years, I have been offering therapeutic massages, with and without oil. My initiation into Reiki also contributes during the sessions to your well-being.

The therapy I offer does not avoid pain. It explores it, in order to give meaning to its presence. The central nervous system does not communicate pain by accident — it signals our internal imbalances.

Through this therapy, we create space for communication with our body; we allow the mind to rest so it can integrate the message and dissolve these imbalances.

Therapy often requires several sessions to obtain deep and lasting results.  
Many years may pass before we intervene in the face of our imbalances — only magic could remove such an accumulation in an instant.

The first step toward a state of balance is the one we take toward ourselves.  
Therapy is only a tool that supports the path we choose.

**My experience:**  
- 35 years of massage  
- …of which 6 years of professional massage  
- 3 years of osteopathy
