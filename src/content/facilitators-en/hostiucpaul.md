Passionate about traditional and holistic medicine, sport, nature, the universe and people, I seek to know each individual by considering the physical, mental, spiritual, emotional and energetic aspects — what makes us whole beings on this wonderful planet.
I hold a degree in physiotherapy and special motor skills, which was the start of my career as a therapist. After completing studies in this branch of modern science something felt incomplete about the whole human being; I kept asking where the other aspects of our being are. Not long after, I had the opportunity to go to China to study and learn the secrets of traditional Chinese medicine and absorb the wisdom of Buddhist and Taoist teachings.
It didn't take more than the first two hours of study for me to fall in love with this mysterious and majestic science.
Focusing on the nature, location and root causes of your ailments, I will help you come closer to yourself — physically, emotionally, energetically and spiritually — so you can reach awareness and healing through your own resources. I look forward to meeting you and guiding you on your journey!
