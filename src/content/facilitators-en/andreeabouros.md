After years spent on the journey to myself, I discovered firsthand (both literally and figuratively) how beneficial massage can be when approached not just as a relaxation for the body but as a holistic therapy (for body, mind, and soul).
I learned to perform relaxation massage, reflexology, therapeutic massage, lymphatic drainage, Lomi Lomi massage (the "loving hands therapy" from Hawaii, which I dare to declare my favorite), and cupping, earning certifications along the way. I enjoy creating and maintaining a safe space for those who choose to place themselves in my hands, with my mission being to apply everything I know, taking into account the particularities of each person, to achieve balance on all levels.
