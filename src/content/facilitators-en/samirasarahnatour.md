          "Every cell in our body is unique and resonates at its own frequency. Using a variety of techniques and therapeutic musical instruments, alchemy takes place at the cellular level. This alchemy brings balance physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually and energetically. The vibrational frequency of therapeutic musical instruments and voice balances the brain hemispheres and softens the nervous system.",
          "Therapeutic bowls help the body enter a state of deep relaxation and guide the brain into theta state — a deeply meditative state. Breathing deepens, heart rate slows, blood pressure drops, the body relaxes, and this new state becomes more receptive to profound healing, releasing stress, tension and worry. Sound alchemy allows deeper connection with ourselves and brings emotional and mental clarity. Additionally, an individual sound alchemy session helps alleviate physical pain, improve sleep patterns and support stress and anxiety relief.",

What feels alive in you, what you feel you want to release. Try not to eat for two hours beforehand or have a light meal. Hydrate well and come dressed comfortably.",

          "The voice is a powerful tool for emotional regulation, energetic harmonization, releasing physical or emotional pain, and bringing us into a state of relaxation.",
          "During our time together, we will work through vocal activation practices and body awareness, guided meditations, vocal and somatic practices, and melodic mantras. All aim to unblock authentic expression, discover your voice's own healing power, deepen your relationship with your own musicality, and complete the cycle of shame and fear arising from how you perceive your voice when you allow yourself to sing. No matter how it sounds, your voice is enough. Your musicality is enough. Your creativity is your native language and needs no training to be allowed to exist. I welcome you into a space of non-judgment to experience how this feels in the body.",
          "The first three sessions focus on three important pillars: breath, body, and embodying the sound of your voice.",
          "We begin with breath and breath awareness in relation to the body, continue with the body and vocal-somatic movements, and then integrate the first two pillars into voice work — working with vowels and musical instruments that support the voice.",

I am Samira, an accredited Sound Practitioner certified by the International Association of Sound Therapy. I am also certified and trained in Swiss Dalcroze music pedagogy through the Certification Program in partnership with the Jaques-Dalcroze Institute in Geneva, where I explore music through the body and its rhythmicity. In addition to these two certifications, in 2021 I obtained an Advanced DNA ThetaHealing Practitioner diploma.

I blend the sounds of therapeutic instruments with somatic movement, body rhythmicity and energy work to create spaces that harmonize the body and connect with spirit. I have participated in numerous training courses, workshops and retreats where I experienced the power of the voice as medicine, including Vocal Odyssey with Nessi Gomes, The Magic & Medicine of Music with Allison Davies, Awakening the Voice with SusieRo, vocal and instrumental coaching with Dominique Zuniga, and 1-1 vocal coaching with Charli Kornblum. I also completed intensive vocal therapy training through the "School for Uncovering the Voice" method taught by Baldo Mikulic. Drawn to Andean wisdom, I am initiated through a mentorship in the Path of the Andean Healer Paqo, guided by Escola Mistica Andina, Nación Q'eros, Cusco.

I offer group sessions or individual vibrational therapy sessions in Bucharest, Romania.

With a background in music, my mission is to hold safe and nourishing spaces where others can raise their voices, heal their relationship with their own voices and their sound identity, and release emotions held captive in body and mind through the power of sound.

In the summer of 2022, I completed a 120-hour intensive Sound Healing training in Spain, where I witnessed the transformative power of frequencies through voice, Tibetan bowls, tuning forks, shamanic drums and other acoustic instruments used for therapeutic purposes.

Sound therapy balances, harmonizes and realigns the body-mind-soul structure. It is medicine for the brain, and the vibrations and frequencies emanating from various therapeutic instruments open inner spaces.
