My name is Vlad, and I am obsessed with movement!

I have been teaching and guiding people towards movement for about 7 years, but I can say that the true understanding of the body came 2-3 years ago, under the guidance of international teachers who opened my vision to the infinite world of movement. Many practices studied and explored were about understanding what happens behind a movement from a neuroscience perspective, thus improving the connection with the body and how it communicates and interacts with the outside world. My approach is organic, involving testing abilities/senses in different contexts and movement scenarios, tasks, and play.
