          "Over time, I have observed that tremor is a natural mechanism of the organism, designed to relax the fascia, muscle and cellular tissue. Tremor is encoded in our DNA. We are practically genetically coded to tremble. Although tremor is generated from the limbic system of the brain, it is not under our conscious control. In other words, techniques that produce tremor bypass the thinking brain, giving us direct access to the unconscious reptilian brain. This allows us to make changes that we otherwise could not achieve.",
          "Through (E)Motion Somatic Release I will work with you to create a safe, supportive environment where you can explore and release psycho-emotional layers and tensions or traumas somatized in the body that might impact your daily life. The method uses a series of techniques to activate the body's natural vibration mechanism such as: light stretching movements, acupressure on certain areas, breathing techniques or gentle touches. These techniques help release tension and trauma retained in the body, allowing you to feel more grounded, present and connected to source.",
          "An important aspect of successful trauma recovery is activating the body's natural release mechanism, which signals the body to return to a state of rest and recovery. The body evokes tremor to complete the discharge of the fight, flight or freeze response it has been subjected to in various life situations.",
          "If you are ready to take advantage of your body's natural vibration mechanism and experience the transformative benefits of (E)Motion Somatic Release, you are invited to explore this unique healing approach.",
