        "Kundalini yoga is a deeply transformative form of yoga that combines postures, breathwork, meditation, and mantras, specifically structured to work with the nervous system. It is not about “perfection” in postures, but about how the practice feels in your body and how it can support you in everyday life.",
        "Trauma informed means that the practice is adapted to respect your limits, your pace, and the way your body responds. We do not force, we do not apply pressure, and there is no requirement to “feel something specific.” You always have options and are constantly invited to choose what feels right for you. Safety (emotional and physical) is more important than “pushing through” a technique.",

        "• a short verbal check-in to see how you are on that day and what your needs are",

        "• a kundalini yoga kriya chosen and adjusted according to your physical and emotional state",
        "• a period of deep relaxation (shavasana), supported by soundbath (bowls, shruti box, other instruments), for integration",
        "• a guided meditation and/or mantra specific to kundalini yoga practice, for clarity and grounding",
        "• a short reflection moment at the end, where you can share what you experienced or observed, if you feel like it",

My name is Ștefi Sandu, and in recent years I have made understanding the relationship between mind and body a priority—first for my own process, and later in order to share with others the techniques that have supported me.

I studied Trauma Informed Kundalini Yoga with Sat Dharam Kaur (co-founder of Compassionate Inquiry and founder of Saibhung Institute), a Yoga Alliance accredited training, in Amritsar, India; I am currently in my second year of Somatic Experiencing® training (Peter Levine), completed Suicide Attention Training within Compassionate Inquiry, trained in sound healing with Aidan McIntyre, am a facilitator of voice through neosomatics (Andrei Pintican method), and a certified fitness trainer (Fitness Education School).

I have experienced firsthand the effects of chronic stress and came to understand how important it is to explore mind and body as an integrated whole—with gentleness, curiosity, patience, and the right people and specialists alongside us.

– “The body keeps the score, and if we listen, the body holds the cure.” –
