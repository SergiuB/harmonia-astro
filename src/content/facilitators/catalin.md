name: "Catalin Andrei"
description: "My journey into yoga began as a personal quest for inner peace and physical well-being, which has evolved into a profound passion for sharing the transformative power of yoga with others. With several years of dedicated practice and teaching, I've developed a teaching style that emphasizes mindfulness, breath control, and alignment, catering to all levels from beginners to advanced practitioners.

My classes are designed to be both challenging and nurturing, encouraging students to explore their limits while respecting their bodies. I specialize in various styles, including Vinyasa, Hatha, and Restorative Yoga, allowing me to offer a holistic yoga experience that balances strength, flexibility, and relaxation. I believe yoga is not just a physical practice but a lifestyle that promotes harmony between the body, mind, and spirit."
